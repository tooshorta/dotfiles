# Dotfiles

I made this repository to hold my config files so I don't have to remake them over and over again. If you're some random person who stumbled across this... Hi :)

If you have any suggestions just let me know, and I'll check them out, because I like using cool tools while programming.

# Fonts

Currently right now I only use one font DepartureMono. Sometime in the future there will be more, but currently It's just one.

# NeoVim

I use NeoVim to write code. I'm still in the learning phase, but soon I'll be a vi wizard... maybe.

# Tmux

I use Tmux to split my terminal. I'm currently working on customizing how it looks/works so it's still a work in progress. Hopefully soon it will be done.

# Ghostty

My terminal emulator is ghostty. It's new, and is written in zig so that's a plus in my book. This is also a work in progress.
